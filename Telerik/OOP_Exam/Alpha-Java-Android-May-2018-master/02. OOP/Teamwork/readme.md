## General Requirements

Please define and implement the following object-oriented assets in your project:

- **Classes** (implementing the application logic)
- **Abstract classes** (with inheritors)
- **Interfaces** (with one or more implementations)
- **Polymorphism usage**
- **Enumerations**
- **Custom exception class** (with usage in your code). You should research on your own about exceptions, exception handling and usages

## Additional Requirements

- Prefer the **StreamingAPI** over loops, when applicable. You should research on your own about StreamingAPI
  - DO NOT use StreamingAPI at any cost, only when it makes sense
- Follow the **best practices for OO design**: use data encapsulation, use exception handling properly, use inheritance, abstraction and polymorphism properly, follow the principles of strong cohesion and loose coupling
- Obligatory use Git to keep your source code and for team collaboration (you might use https://github.com/)
- Provide a class diagram (to visualize all types)

## Optional Requirements

If you have a chance, time and a suitable situation, you might add some of the following to your project:
- Static members (fields, constructor, etc.)
- Constants, generic types
- Implementation of `Enumerable<T>`, `ToString()`
- User interface (UI) – console, desktop, web, mobile or as you like it the most

## Non-Required Work

- Completely finished project is not obligatory required. It will not be a big problem if your project is not completely finished or is not working greatly. This team work project is for educational purpose. Its main purpose it to experience object-oriented modeling and OOP in a real-world project and to get some experience in team working and team collaboration with Git.

## Deliverables

- The complete source code.
- Brief documentation of your project in **.md**(markdown). It should provide the following information (in brief):
  - Team name and list of team members (with http://telerikacademy.com usernames)
  - Project purpose – what problem do you solve and how?
  - Class diagram of your types
  - The URL of your Git repository
  - Any other information (optionally)
- Obligatory upload your projects in the Showcase system (http://best.telerikacademy.com/)
- Optionally provide a PowerPoint presentation designed for the project defense

## Public Project Defense

Each team will have to deliver a public defense of its work in front of the trainers and give a short presentation in front of the other students. You will have around 30 minutes for the following:
- Demonstrate the application
- Show the class diagram
- Show the source code in the Git web-based source code browser.
- Show the commits logs to confirm that each team member has contributed.

## Give Feedback about Your Teammates

You will be invited to provide feedback about all your teammates, their attitude to this project, their technical skills, their team working skills, their contribution to the project, etc. The feedback is important part of the project evaluation so **take it seriously and be honest**.
